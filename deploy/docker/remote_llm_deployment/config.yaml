    caption_summarization: "Summarize the frame-by-frame captions into bullet points in the format start_time:end_time: detailed_event_description. Use '.' to separate hours, minutes and seconds. Ignore routine activity and focus on noteworthy events. Only output the bullet points."

Given the caption in the form start_time:end_time: caption, Aggregate the following captions in the format start_time:end_time:event_description. If the event_description is the same as another event_description, aggregate the captions in the format start_time1:end_time1,...,start_timek:end_timek:event_description. If any two adjacent end_time1 and start_time2 is within a few tenths of a second, merge the captions in the format start_time1:end_time2. The output should only contain bullet points.  Cluster the output into Unsafe Behavior, Operational Inefficiencies, Potential Equipment Damage and Unauthorized Personnel"
